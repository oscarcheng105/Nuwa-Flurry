<h1>Assignment 42. Editing and scripting</h1>

<p><small>[<a href='../index.html'>97 home</a> &gt; <a href='../assign.html'>assignments</a>]</small></p>

<p>This assignment is designed to give you familiarity with two
  things. The first is Emacs, the classic programmable text editor
  that is a prototype for
  modern <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment'>integrated
  development environments</a> (IDEs). The second is scripting with
  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell'>POSIX-compatible
  shells</a>.  Software developers should be expert in both IDEs and
  scripting, even if they don't necessarily use these particular
  tools.</p>

<p>Do this assignment on the SEASnet GNU/Linux servers
<samp>lnxsrv06</samp>, <samp>lnxsrv07</samp>,
<samp>lnxsrv09</samp>, or <samp>lnxsrv10</samp>,
with <samp>/usr/local/cs/bin</samp>
prepended to your <samp>PATH</samp>.</p>

<p>If you need a hint, ask a <abbr>TA</abbr> or an <abbr>LA</abbr>.
This assignment is not intended to be done without any hints.</p>

<h2>Laboratory: Linux and Emacs scavenger hunt</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Emacs supplies its own tutorial; run Emacs and type <samp>C-h t</samp>.</li>

<p>Instructions:
Do the lab part of this assignment (including all shell commands and editing)
under Emacs, and start your Emacs session by
running <samp>M-x open-dribble-file</samp> command to create
a dribble file <samp>lab1.drib</samp> in your home directory
that records everything you type.
(If you do multiple Emacs sessions, name your dribble
files <samp>lab2.drib</samp>, <samp>lab3.drib</samp>, etc.)
</p>

<!-- DELETE-ME DELETE-ME DELETE-ME -->
<p>
For the editing lab exercises,
use intelligent ways of answering the questions. For example, if
asked to move to the first occurrence of the word "scrumptious", do not
merely use cursor keys to move the cursor by hand; instead, use the
builtin search capabilities to find "scrumptious" quickly.
</p>
<p>
To start, download a copy of the web page you're looking at into a
file named <samp>assign1.html</samp>. You can do this
with <a href='https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/'>Wget</a>
or <a href='https://curl.haxx.se/'>curl</a>.
Use <samp><a href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cp.html'>cp</a></samp>
to make three copies of this file. Call the copies
<samp>exer1.html</samp>, <samp>exer2.html</samp>, and <samp>exer3.html</samp>.
</p>

<h3>Lab 1.1: Moving around in Emacs</h3>

<ol>
<li>Use Emacs to edit the file <samp>exer1.html</samp>.</li>
<li>Move the cursor to just after the first occurrence of the word "HTML" (all upper-case).</li>
<li>Now move the cursor to the start of the first later occurrence of the word "scavenger".</li>
<li>Now move the cursor to the start of the first later occurrence of the word "self-referential".</li>
<li>Now move the cursor to the start of the first later occurrence of the word "arro&#119;".</li>
<li>Now move the cursor to the end of the current line.</li>
<li>Now move the cursor to the beginning of the current line.</li>
<li>
Doing the above tasks with the arrow keys takes many keystrokes, or it
involves holding down keys for a long time. Can you think of a way to
do it with fewer keystrokes by using some of the commands available in
Emacs?
<li>Did you move the cursor using the arrow keys? If so, repeat the
above steps, without using the arrow keys.</li>
<li>When you are done, exit Emacs.</li>
</ol>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Lab 1.2: Deleting text in Emacs</h3>

<ol>
<li>Use Emacs to edit the file <samp>exer2.html</samp>. The idea is to
delete its HTML comments; the resulting page should display the same
text as the original.</li>

<li>Delete the 41st line, which is an HTML comment. <samp>&lt;!-- HTML comments look like this. --&gt;</samp></li>
<li>Delete the HTML comment containing the text
"<samp>DELETE-ME DELETE-ME DELETE-ME</samp>".</li>
<li>Delete the HTML comment containing the text "<samp>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_comment#Comments</samp>".</li>
<li>There are two more HTML comments; delete them too.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Once again, try to accomplish the tasks using a small number of keystrokes.
When you are done, save the file and exit back to the command line. You can
check your work by using a browser to view <samp>exer2.html</samp>. Also,
check that you haven't deleted something that you want to keep, by using
the following command:</p>

<pre><samp><a href='https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/'>diff</a> -u exer1.html exer2.html &gt;exer2.diff
</samp></pre>

<p>The output file <samp>exer2.diff</samp> should describe only text
that you wanted to remove. Don't remove <samp>exer2.diff</samp>;
you'll need it later.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Lab 1.3: Inserting text in Emacs</h3>

<ol>
<li>Use Emacs to edit the file <samp>exer3.html</samp>.</li>

<li>Change the first two instances of "Assignment 1" to "Assignment 42".</li>
<li>Change the first instance of "UTF-8" to "US-ASCII".</li>
<li>Ooops! The file is not ASCII so you need to fix that. Remove every
  line containing a non-ASCII character. You can find the next
  non-ASCII character by searching for the regular
  expression <samp>[^[:ascii:]]</samp>.
<li>Insert an empty line after the first line containing
"<samp>&lt;/ol&gt;</samp>".</li>

<li>When you finish, save the text file and exit Emacs. As before,
use the <samp>diff</samp> command to check your work.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Lab 1.4: Other editing tasks in Emacs</h3>

<p>
In addition to inserting and deleting text, there are other common tasks
that you should know, like copy and paste, search and replace, and undo.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Execute the command "<samp>cat exer2.html exer2.diff &gt;exer4.html</samp>"
to create a file <samp>exer4.html</samp> that contains a copy of <samp>exer2.html</samp> followed by a copy of <samp>exer2.diff</samp>.</li>
<li>Use Emacs to edit the file <samp>exer4.html</samp>.
The idea is to edit the file so that it looks identical
to <samp>exer1.html</samp> on a browser, but the file itself is a
little bit different internally.</li>

<li>Go to the end of the file. Copy the new lines in the last chunk
of diff output, and paste them into the correct location earlier in the file.</li>
<li>Repeat the process, until the earlier part of the file is identical
to what was in the original.</li>
<li>Delete the last part of the file, which contains the diff output.</li>
<li>&hellip; except we didn't really want to do that, so undo the deletion.</li>

<li>Turn the diff output into a comment, by surrounding it with
  "<samp>&lt;!--</samp>" and "<samp>--&gt;</samp>".
  If the diff output itself contains end-comment markers "<samp>--&gt;</samp>",
  escape them by replacing each such "<samp>--&gt;</samp>" with
  "<samp>--&amp;gt;</samp>".

<li>Now let's try some search and replaces.
Search the text document for the pattern "<samp>&lt;ol&gt;</samp>".
How many instances did you find?
Use the search and
replace function to replace them all with the final-caps
equivalent "<samp>&lt;oL&gt;</samp>".</li>

<li>Check your work with viewing <samp>exer4.html</samp> with an HTML
browser, and by running the shell command "<samp>diff -u
exer1.html exer4.html &gt;exer4.diff</samp>". The only differences
should be changes from "<samp>&lt;ol&gt;</samp>" to "<samp>&lt;oL&gt;</samp>",
and a long HTML comment at the end.</li>

</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Lab 1.5: Exploring the operating system outside Emacs</h3>

<p>Use the commands that you learned in class to find
answers to the following questions. Don't use a search engine like Google, and
don't ask your neighbor, don't use GitHub, etc.
When you find a new command, run it so you can see exactly how it
works.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Where are the <samp>mv</samp> and <samp>sh</samp> programs
located in the file system?
</li>

<li>
What executable programs in <samp>/usr/bin</samp>
have names that are exactly two characters
long and end in <samp>r</samp>,
and what do they do?
</li>

<li>
When you execute the command named by the symbolic
link <samp>/usr/bin/emacs</samp>, which file actually is
executed?
</li>

<li>
What is the version number of the <samp>/usr/bin/gcc</samp> program?
of the plain <samp>gcc</samp> program? Why are they different programs?
</li>

<li>
The <samp>chmod</samp> program changes permissions on a file. What
does the symbolic mode <samp>u+sx,o-w</samp> mean, in terms of permissions?</li>

<li>
Use the <samp>find</samp> command to find all directories modified in
the last four weeks that are located under (or are the same as) the
directory <samp>/usr/local/cs</samp>.
</li>

<li>
Of the files in the same directory as <samp>find</samp>, how many of
them are symbolic links?
</li>

<li>
What is the oldest regular file in the <samp>/usr/lib64</samp>
directory? Use the last-modified time to determine age. Specify the
name of the file without the <samp>/usr/lib64/</samp> prefix. Consider
files whose names start with "<samp>.</samp>".
</li>

<li>
Where does the <samp>locale</samp> command get its data from?
</li>

<li>
In Emacs, what commands have <samp>downcase</samp> in their name?
</li>

<li>
Briefly, what do the Emacs keystrokes <samp>C-M-r</samp>
through <samp>C-M-v</samp> do? Can you list their actions
concisely?
</li>

<li>
In more detail, what does the Emacs keystroke <samp>C-g</samp> do?
</li>

<li>
What does the Emacs <samp>yank</samp> function do, and how
can you easily invoke it using keystrokes?
</li>

<li>
When looking at the directory <samp>/usr/bin</samp>, what's the
difference between the output of the <samp>ls -l</samp> command,
and the directory listing of the Emacs <samp>dired</samp> command?
</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Lab 1.6: Doing commands in Emacs</h3>

<p>
Do these tasks all within Emacs. Don't use a shell subcommand
if you can avoid it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new directory named "<samp>junk</samp>" that's right under
your home directory.</li>

<li>In that directory, create a C source file <samp>hello.c</samp>
that contains the following text. Take care to get the text exactly
right, with no trailing spaces or empty lines, with the
initial <samp>#</samp> in the leftmost column of the first line, and
with all other lines indented to match exactly as shown:

<pre><samp>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int
main (void)
{
  for (;;)
    {
      int c = getchar ();
      if (c &lt; 0)
        {
          if (ferror (stdin))
            perror ("stdin");
          else
            fprintf (stderr, "EOF on input\n");
          return 1;
        }
      if (putchar (c) &lt; 0 || (c == '\n' &amp;&amp; fclose (stdout) != 0))
        {
          perror ("stdout");
          return 1;
        }
      if (c == '\n')
        return 0;
    }
}
</samp></pre>
</li>

<li>Compile this file, using the Emacs <samp>M-x compile</samp> command.
</li>

<li>Run the compiled program from Emacs using the <samp>M-!</samp> command,
and put the program's standard output into a file
  named <samp>hello-a1</samp> and its standard error into a file
  <samp>hello-a2</samp>.</li>

<li>Same as before, except run the program with standard
  input being closed,
  and put the program's standard output and error into
  <samp>hello-b1</samp> and <samp>hello-b2</samp>, respectively.
  Here, &ldquo;closed&rdquo; does not mean the standard input is an empty file;
  it means that standard input is not open at all, to any file.</li>

<li>Same as before, except run the program with standard
  input being the file <samp>/etc/passwd</samp>,
  and put the program's standard output and error into
  <samp>hello-c1</samp> and <samp>hello-c2</samp>.</li>

<li>Same as before, except run the program with standard
  input being the file <samp>/etc/passwd</samp>
  and standard output being the file <samp>/dev/full</samp>,
  and put the program's standard error into <samp>hello-d2</samp>.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Homework: Scripting in the shell</h2>

<p>For the homework assume youre in the standard C or <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX'>POSIX</a> <a
href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap07.html#tag_07'>locale</a>. The
shell command <a
href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/locale.html'><samp>locale</samp></a>
should output <samp>LC_CTYPE="C"</samp>
or <samp>LC_CTYPE="POSIX"</samp>. If it doesnt, use the following
shell command:</p>

<pre><samp><a href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#export'>export</a> LC_ALL='C'
</samp></pre>

<p>and make sure <samp>locale</samp> outputs the right thing afterwards.</p>

<h3>Shell scripting</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Steve Parker, <a
  href='https://www.shellscript.sh/'>Shell Scripting Tutorial</a> (2020)</li>
 <li>The Open Group,
   <a href='https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html'>Shell Command Language</a> (2018)</li>
</ul>

<p>Examine the file <samp>/usr/share/dict/linux.words</samp>, which
  contains a list of English words, one per line.
  Each word consists of one or more ASCII characters.</p>

<p>Sort this file and put the sorted output into a file <samp>sorted.words</samp>.</p>

<p>Then, take a text file containing the HTML in this
assignments web page, and run the following commands with that
text file being standard input. Look generally at what each command
outputs (in particular, how its output differs from that of the
previous command), and why.</p>

<pre><samp>tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - sorted.words
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - sorted.words
</samp></pre>

<p>Lets take the last command
as the crude implementation of an
  English spelling checker.
  This implementation mishandles the input file <samp>sorted.words</samp>!
  Write a shell script named <samp>myspell</samp>
  that fixes this problem.
  Your script should read from standard input and output
  misspelled words to standard output, for a suitable
  definition of "words".
  The shell command:</p>

<pre><samp>myspell &lt;/usr/share/dict/linux.words
</samp></pre>

<p>
  should output nothing, because
  the dictionary by definition contains only correctly-spelled words.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Submit</h2>

<!-- You can learn more about HTML comments at
	<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_comment#Comments>.
	-->

	  <p>Submit the following files within a compressed <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)'>tarball</a> named
	    <samp>assign1.tgz</samp>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><samp>lab1.drib</samp> and any later dribble files that you generate.</li>
  <li>The <samp>hello-??</samp> files of Lab 1.6.</li>
  <li><samp>myspell</samp></li>
  <li><samp>notes.txt</samp>, a text file containing any other
    notes or comments that you'd like us to see.</li>
</ul>

<p>All files other than the <samp>.drib</samp> files should use
  GNU/Linux style,
  i.e., <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8'>UTF-8</a>
  encoding with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRLF#Representation'>LF-terminated lines</a>.</p>

<p>The shell command:</p>

<pre><samp>tar -tvf assign1.tgz</samp>
</pre>

<p>should output a list of file names that contains <samp>myspell</samp>
  etc., with sizes and other metainformation about the files.</p>
<!--
<p>Or maybe more lines, if something has gone wrong.</p>
