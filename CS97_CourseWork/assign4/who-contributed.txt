I used this method from git log

git log -S "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."

which help us find out when a string is added or removed

We then get this information:

	Author: Arthur David Olson <ado@elsie>
	Date:   Thu Dec 21 11:43:42 1995 -0500

	   Eggert changes
    
	    SCCS-file: northamerica
	    SCCS-SID: 7.20

Meaning that it's added in "Thu Dec 21 11:43:42 1995 -0500" by Arthur David Olson <ado@elsie>
